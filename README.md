# Impact of Smoking on Health Insurance Premiums

## 🚀 Project Overview
This comprehensive analysis delves into the effect of smoking on health insurance premiums, utilizing data science techniques to uncover how smoking status, Body Mass Index (BMI), age, and regional differences influence insurance costs. The insights derived from this project aim to aid insurance companies in refining their risk assessment and pricing strategies.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Determine the correlation between smoking status and insurance charges.
- Examine the compounded effect of BMI on the insurance costs of smokers vs. non-smokers.
- Analyze the impact of regional smoking trends on insurance premiums.
- Provide actionable insights for nuanced insurance pricing models.
