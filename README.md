# Impact of Smoking on Health Insurance Premiums

## üöÄ Project Overview
This comprehensive analysis delves into the effect of smoking on health insurance premiums, utilizing data science techniques to uncover how smoking status, Body Mass Index (BMI), age, and regional differences influence insurance costs. The insights derived from this project aim to aid insurance companies in refining their risk assessment and pricing strategies.

## üéØ Objectives
- Determine the correlation between smoking status and insurance charges.
- Examine the compounded effect of BMI on the insurance costs of smokers vs. non-smokers.
- Analyze the impact of regional smoking trends on insurance premiums.
- Provide actionable insights for nuanced insurance pricing models.

## üìä Data Exploration
The dataset encompasses:
- Insurance charge records, categorized by smoking status, BMI, age, and region.
- Comparative analysis between smokers and non-smokers' insurance premiums.
- Regional smoking prevalence data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Techniques
- **Python & Jupyter Notebooks**: For data preprocessing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **SciPy**: For conducting statistical tests.
- **Tableau**: For interactive dashboards and visual storytelling.

### Project Lifecycle Techniques
- **Data Preparation**: Included missing value imputation, data type conversions, outlier treatment, and normalization to ensure clean, analysis-ready data.
- **Exploratory Analysis**: Utilized descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visual exploration to uncover initial insights and inform feature selection.
- **Feature Engineering**: Involved creating, transforming, and selecting features to enhance model accuracy and interpretability.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Employed regression and classification techniques, evaluated through cross-validation and performance metrics to ensure model robustness.
- **Visualization and Storytelling**: Leveraged Tableau for interactive dashboards and employed data storytelling to present findings effectively.

## üîç Key Insights
- Smoking status is a significant determinant of insurance premiums, independent of BMI and age.
- The disparity in insurance costs between smokers and non-smokers is exacerbated by higher BMI values.
- Regional smoking trends provide a basis for localized insurance pricing strategies.
- Recommendations are provided for insurance companies to incorporate smoking status into their pricing models effectively.
